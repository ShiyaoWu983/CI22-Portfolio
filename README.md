The collection of the text is from one of my favorite book, The Miracles of the Namiya General Store by Keigo Higashino.
This letter appears at the end of the entire book, seemingly to a character in the book, but actually to us who are reading the book.
This letter says that life is a blank piece of paper and we can all write our own lives.
I thought this passage was perfect for this assignment, as if I were creating something random on a blank piece of paper.
