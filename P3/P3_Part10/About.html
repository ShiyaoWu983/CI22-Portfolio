<p class="about">
    Seeing such a bold color around my home radiates energy and makes me feel motivated. 
    The goal of this project is to create a gallery to show all the red accents in my 
    daily life. I started to collect items from my home and documented them. With the 
    items that I collected, I want to create a virtual exhibition. The exhibition will 
    show the importance of the color red in people’s daily life and how the color 
    affects them in different ways. Does it make you ambitious? or Does it annoy 
    you? The website should be easy to follow and have a continuous transition to 
    the next item. Every aspect should be red or should make the audience remind red. 
    Also, the images shouldn’t blend with the website but stand out, even though the 
    aesthetic is red.
